# [SonBook](https://son-book.herokuapp.com/)- A Social Media Website

This works like a basic functional Facebook/Twitter.

Keywords: MERN, Webpack, Material-UI, JSON WebToken, RESTful architecture and
many other extra modules.

## Features

- User can make CRUD operations, including: sign-up, sign-in, see all the users,
edit/delete his/her profile while being authenticated/authorized to do so.
- Follow/unfollow users of all kinds, just like on Facebook/Twitter.
- Like/Unlike users of all kinds, just like on Facebook/Twitter.
- Find users whom the user has not followed and have a recommendation to follow
them if needed be.
- See all the posts you have made inside your own profile, which makes a covenient
place for private chatting with your followers.

- Like/Unline comments of people who have made comments on your own posts.

## Potential features

- Adding emoticon
- Adding an interactive chat API using Socket.io

I have cut the potential features, for I need time to finish many other projects.
